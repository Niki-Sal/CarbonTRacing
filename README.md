# Saving Our ðŸŒŽ
A game trying to teach the impact of human's daily choices on planet by translating them to carbon footprint scaled scores in simple terms


### Motivation
Sustainability is one of my personal interests and area of study. Carbon dioxide emissions account for 82 percent of todayâ€™s global warming. I believe each one of us can take small yet significant steps to protect our planet in our daily activities.

### Future development
What are the next steps for the project? How will you continue to evolve it?

1- Add more tasks with more variable activities to accomplish them. 
2- User could add their own task and get some sustainable activity related to them for suggestion. 
3- Another improvement could be change of win/lose conditions based on game level.
